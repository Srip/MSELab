PROTOCOL: 
  	 Similar to an interface in Java.
	 List of methods that any class can declare itself to 	 	 implement.
	 A class implementing a protocol must implement all its 		 methods,else compiler will emit an error.
	 It is possible to implement multiple protocols.
         Implemetation file not required.

Eg:
   @protocol System
    -(void)systemName;
    -(void)systemNumber;

    @interface Windows:NSObject <System>
    //..
    @end

SUBCLASSING: 
	    Inherits methods and instance variables from its 	    superclass.
	    Multiple inheritance is not allowed.
	    Implemetation as well as interface file is necesssary.
	    Not required to implement all the methods of the base 	    class.

Eg :@interface subclass : baseClass
	{
		//instance variables
	}
	//methods
    @end
